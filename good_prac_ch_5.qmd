## Data Provenance 

It matters where you are getting your data. Think about:

- **Validity**:

     - Is this data trustworthy? Is it authentic?
     - Where did the data come from?
     - How has the data been changed / managed over time?
     - Is the data complete?

- **Comprehension**:

     - Is this data accurate?
     - Can you explain your results?
     - Is this the right data to answer your question?

- **Reproducibility**:

     - People should be able to fully replicate your results from your raw data and code.

## Documenting Data Sources

**Document your data source like a museum curator** `r fa("magnifying-glass")`

Whenever you download data, you should **at a minimum** record the following:

- The name of the file you are describing.
- The date you downloaded it.
- The original name of the downloaded file (in case you renamed it).
- The url to the site you downloaded it from.
- The source of the _original_ data (sometimes different from the site you downloaded it from).
- A short description of the data, maybe how they were collected (if available).
- A dictionary for the data (e.g. a simple markdown table describing each variable).

When starting your search for data to address a research question, think about:\n\n**Validity**\n\n- Is this data trustworthy? Is it authentic?\n- Where did the data come from?\n- How has the data been changed / managed over time?\n- Is the data complete?\n\n**Comprehension**\n\n- Is this data accurate?\n- Can you explain your results?\n- Is this the right data to answer your question?\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\nPeople should be able to fully replicate your results from your raw data and code.\n\n## Documenting Data Sources\n\n**Document your data source like a museum curator**\n\nWhenever you download data, you should **at a minimum** record the following:\n\n- The name of the file you are describing.\n- The date you downloaded it.\n- The original name of the downloaded file (in case you renamed it).\n- The url to the site you downloaded it from.\n- The source of the _original_ data (sometimes different from the site you downloaded it from).\n- A short description of the data, maybe how they were collected (if available).\n- A dictionary for the data (e.g. a simple markdown table describing each variable).\n",

These usually read in well and the function assumes the first row is the header.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\ncsvPath <- here('data', 'milk_production.csv')\nmilk_production <- read_csv(csvPath)\n\nhead(milk_production)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 6 × 4\n#>   region    state          year milk_produced\n#>   <chr>     <chr>         <dbl>         <dbl>\n#> 1 Northeast Maine          1970     619000000\n#> 2 Northeast New Hampshire  1970     356000000\n#> 3 Northeast Vermont        1970    1970000000\n#> 4 Northeast Massachusetts  1970     658000000\n#> 5 Northeast Rhode Island   1970      75000000\n#> 6 Northeast Connecticut    1970     661000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Importing Text Files (.txt)\n\nRead in `.txt` files with `read.table()`. These kinds of files are a little more \"raw\", and you may need to specify the `skip` argument (how many rows to skip before you get to the header row) and `header` arguments (whether the first row is the header or not). In this example, the data looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLand-Ocean Temperature Index (C)\n--------------------------------\n\nYear No_Smoothing  Lowess(5)\n----------------------------\n1880     -0.15     -0.08\n1881     -0.07     -0.12\n1882     -0.10     -0.15\n1883     -0.16     -0.19\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo we need to skip the first 5 rows and then set the header to `FALSE`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntxtPath <- here('data', 'nasa_global_temps.txt')\nglobal_temps <- read.table(txtPath, skip = 5, header = FALSE)\n\nhead(global_temps)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#>     V1    V2    V3\n#> 1 1880 -0.15 -0.08\n#> 2 1881 -0.07 -0.12\n#> 3 1882 -0.10 -0.15\n#> 4 1883 -0.16 -0.19\n#> 5 1884 -0.27 -0.23\n#> 6 1885 -0.32 -0.25\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Importing Excel Files (.xlsx)\n\nRead in `.xlsx` files with `read_excel()`. With Excel files it's a good idea to specify the sheet to read in using the `sheet` argument:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nxlsxPath <- here('data', 'pv_cell_production.xlsx')\npv_cells <- read_excel(xlsxPath, sheet = 'Cell Prod by Country', skip = 2)\n\nhead(pv_cells)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 6 × 10\n#>   Year  China     Taiwan Japan Malaysia Germany `South Korea` `United States`\n#>   <chr> <chr>     <chr>  <dbl> <chr>    <chr>   <chr>                   <dbl>\n#> 1 <NA>  Megawatts <NA>    NA   <NA>     <NA>    <NA>                     NA  \n#> 2 <NA>  <NA>      <NA>    NA   <NA>     <NA>    <NA>                     NA  \n#> 3 1995  NA        NA      16.4 NA       NA      NA                       34.8\n#> 4 1996  NA        NA      21.2 NA       NA      NA                       38.8\n#> 5 1997  NA        NA      35   NA       NA      NA                       51  \n#> 6 1998  NA        NA      49   NA       NA      NA                       53.7\n#> # ℹ 2 more variables: Others <chr>, World <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Basic plots in R\n\nR has a number of built-in tools for basic graph types. Usually we use these for quick plots just to get a sense of the data I'm working with. We almost never use these for final charts that we want to show others (for that we use `ggplot2`). While there are other built in chart types, we will only show the two we find most useful for quickly exploring data: scatter plots and histograms.\n\n### Scatter plots with `plot()`\n\nA scatter plot helps us see if there is any correlational relationship between two numeric variables. These need to be two \"continuous\" variables, like _time_, _age_, _money_, etc...things that are not categorical in nature (as opposed to \"discrete\" variables, like _nationality_). Here's a scatterplot of the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of cars over their respective horsepower using the `mtcars` dataset:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(x = mtcars$hp, y = mtcars$mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/scatter-basic-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot showing the relationship between horsepower (mtcars$hp) on the x-axis and miles per gallon (mtcars$mpg) on the y-axis. The plot displays a negative correlation, with mpg generally decreasing as horsepower increases. Data points are represented by open circles and are scattered across the plot, with horsepower values ranging from about 50 to 300, and mpg values ranging from about 10 to 35. The relationship appears to be non-linear, with a steeper decline in mpg at lower horsepower values.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe basic inputs to the `plot()` function are `x` and `y`, which must be vectors of the same length. You can customize many features (fonts, colors, axes, shape, titles, etc.) through [graphic options](http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/parameters.html). Here's the same plot with a few customizations:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(\n  x    = mtcars$hp,\n  y    = mtcars$mpg,\n  col  = 'darkblue', # \"col\" changes the point color\n  pch  = 19, # \"pch\" changes the point shape\n  main = \"\",\n  xlab = \"Horsepower\",\n  ylab = \"Miles Per Gallon\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/scatter-basic-pretty-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot showing the relationship between Horsepower (x-axis) and Miles Per Gallon (y-axis) for various cars. The plot displays a negative correlation, with fuel efficiency decreasing as horsepower increases. Data points are represented by solid blue circles. Horsepower values range from about 50 to 300, while Miles Per Gallon values range from approximately 10 to 35. The relationship appears non-linear, with a steeper decline in MPG at lower horsepower values.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFrom this scatter plot, we can observe the relationship between a car's horsepower and its fuel efficiency. As you may have guessed, cars with more horsepower or more powerful engines have less fuel efficiency.\n\n### Histograms with `hist()`\n\nThe [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) is one of the most common ways to visualize the _distribution_ of a single, continuous, numeric variable. The `hist()` function takes just one variable: `x`. Here's a histogram of the `waiting` variable showing the wait times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(x = faithful$waiting)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/hist-basic-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Histogram showing the distribution of waiting times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser. The plot displays a unimodal distribution with a peak around 70 minutes. The histogram is divided into 20 bins, with the x-axis representing waiting times in minutes and the y-axis representing the frequency of eruptions.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith this plot, we can see a trend where the geyser mostly erupts in roughly 50 or 80 minute intervals. As with the `plot()` function, you can customize a lot of the histogram features. One common customization is to modify the number of \"bins\" in the histogram by changing the `breaks` argument. Here we'll fix the number of bins to `20` to get a clearer look at the data:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(\n  x      = faithful$waiting,\n  breaks = 20,\n  col    = 'lightblue3',\n  main   = \"Waiting Times Between Eruptions\",\n  xlab   = \"Waiting Time (in minutes)\",\n  ylab   = \"Count\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/hist-basic-pretty-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Histogram showing the distribution of waiting times between eruptions, titled \\'Waiting Times Between Eruptions\\'. The x-axis represents waiting time in minutes, ranging from 40 to 90. The y-axis shows the count of occurrences, with a maximum of about 27. The distribution appears bimodal, with peaks around 50-55 minutes and 75-80 minutes. The histogram uses light blue bars, and the overall shape suggests two clusters of waiting times.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith our changes, the chart is cleaner and it is clearer which waiting times the were most common.\n\n## Better figures with `ggplot2`\n\n[Art by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)]{.aside}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/horst_monsters_ggplot2.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Colorful illustration promoting ggplot2 data visualization.

A “grammar of graphics” (that’s what the “gg” in “ggplot2” stands for) is a framework that uses layers to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner. Here’s a visual summary of the concept:\n\n[[Image Source](https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop03/book-en/grammar-of-graphics-gg-basics.html)]{.aside}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/ggplot-layers.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Diagram showing the layers of a ggplot2 plot. It has four columns labeled \\'Aesthetics\\', \\'Axis\\', \\'Theme\\', and \\'Output\\'. The \\'Aesthetics\\' column shows a scatter plot with points transitioning from blue to red as they move up and right. The \\'Axis\\' column displays the same plot with labeled axes: \\'Variable 1\\' (x-axis) and \\'Variable 2\\' (y-axis). The \\'Theme\\' column shows a gray rectangle representing the plot background. The \\'Output\\' column combines all elements, showing the scatter plot with axes and a gray background. Below, the columns are labeled \\'Layer 1\\', \\'Layer 2\\', and \\'Layer 3\\' respectively. Plus signs between columns indicate the additive nature of these layers.' width=600}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Making plot layers with ggplot2\n\nEvery ggplot is built with several layers. At a minimum, you need to specify the data, the aesthetic mapping, and the geometry. We also like to add labels and a theme, so my basic ggplot \"recipe\" usually contains at least five layers:\n\n1. The data\n2. The aesthetic mapping (what goes on the axes?)\n3. The geometries (points? bars? etc.)\n4. The annotations / labels\n5. The theme\n\n#### Layer 1: The data\n\nFor this example, we'll use the `mpg` dataset, which contains information on the fuel efficiency of various cars:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 6 × 11\n#>   manufacturer model displ  year   cyl trans    drv     cty   hwy fl    class\n#>   <chr>        <chr> <dbl> <int> <int> <chr>    <chr> <int> <int> <chr> <chr>\n#> 1 audi         a4      1.8  1999     4 auto(l5) f        18    29 p     comp…\n#> 2 audi         a4      1.8  1999     4 manual(… f        21    29 p     comp…\n#> 3 audi         a4      2    2008     4 manual(… f        20    31 p     comp…\n#> 4 audi         a4      2    2008     4 auto(av) f        21    30 p     comp…\n#> 5 audi         a4      2.8  1999     6 auto(l5) f        16    26 p     comp…\n#> 6 audi         a4      2.8  1999     6 manual(… f        18    26 p     comp…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `ggplot()` function initializes the plot with whatever data you're using. When you run this, you'll get a blank plot because you haven't told ggplot what to do with the data yet:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/ggblank-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Blank plot with no data displayed.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Layer 2: The aesthetic mapping\n\nThe `aes()` function determines which variables will be _mapped_ to the geometries (e.g. the axes). Here I'll map the `displ` variable to the x-axis and the `hwy` variable to the y-axis. Still you don't see much, but at least you can now see that the variables are there along the axes.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/ggaes-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Empty scatter plot with a gray background and white gridlines. The x-axis is labeled \"displ\" and ranges from 2 to 7. The y-axis is labeled \"hwy\" and ranges from 20 to 40. No data points or trend lines are visible on the plot.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Layer 3: The geometries\n\nThe geometries are the visual representations of the data. Here I'll use `geom_point()` to create a scatter plot. Now this is starting to look like what we saw before with the simple `plot()` function:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/ggpoint-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot showing the relationship between engine displacement (displ) on the x-axis and highway fuel efficiency (hwy) on the y-axis. The x-axis ranges from 2 to 7, while the y-axis ranges from 20 to 40. Data points are represented by black dots. There is a general negative trend, with higher displacement values corresponding to lower highway fuel efficiency. The plot has a gray background with white gridlines. Points are clustered more densely in the lower displacement range and become sparser as displacement increases.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Layer 4: The annotations / labels\n\nUse `labs()` to modify the plot labels. The arguments in the `labs()` function match those from the `aes()` mapping, so `x` refers to `displ` and `y` refers to `hwy`. We also added a title:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Engine displacement (liters)\",\n    y = \"Highway fuel economy (mpg)\",\n    title = \"Most larger engine vehicles are less fuel efficient\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/gglabs-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot titled \\'Most larger engine vehicles are less fuel efficient\\'. The x-axis shows \\'Engine displacement (liters)\\' ranging from 2 to 7, and the y-axis shows \\'Highway fuel economy (mpg)\\' ranging from 20 to 45. Black dots represent individual vehicles. There\\'s a clear negative trend: as engine displacement increases, fuel economy generally decreases. Data points are more concentrated at lower displacements and higher fuel economies, becoming sparser as displacement increases and fuel economy decreases. The plot has a light gray background with white gridlines.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Layer 5: The theme\n\nThe theme controls the overall look of the plot. Here I'll use `theme_bw()` (black and white theme) to make the plot look a little nicer:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Engine displacement (liters)\",  \n    y = \"Highway fuel economy (mpg)\", \n    title = \"Most larger engine vehicles are less fuel efficient\"\n  ) + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/ggtheme_bw-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot titled \"Most larger engine vehicles are less fuel efficient\". The x-axis shows \"Engine displacement (liters)\" ranging from 2 to 7, and the y-axis shows \"Highway fuel economy (mpg)\" ranging from 15 to 45. Black dots represent individual vehicles. There is a clear negative trend: as engine displacement increases, fuel economy generally decreases. Data points are more concentrated at lower displacements and higher fuel economies, becoming sparser as displacement increases and fuel economy decreases. The plot has a white background with light gray gridlines.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Common themes\n\nThere are LOTS of ggplot themes. Here are a few we use the most:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\n\n`theme_bw()`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/ggtheme_bw2-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Scatter plot showing the relationship between engine displacement (displ) on the x-axis and highway fuel efficiency (hwy) on the y-axis.

There is a clear negative trend, with higher displacement values generally corresponding to lower highway fuel efficiency. The plot has a white background with light gray gridlines.

Format data frame\n2. Add geoms\n3. Can you read the labels?\n4. Do you need to rearrange the categories?\n5. Adjust scales\n6. Adjust theme\n7. Annotate\n\n### Step 1. Format the data frame\n\nOne of the most common mistakes people make is not formatting the data frame correctly. If you want to map variables to axes on a plot, you need to make sure those variables are in the data frame!\n\nIn this example, we'll just plot a bar chart of the number of wildlife impacts by operator. We can obtain this summary data with the `count()` function, which is kind of like calling `nrow()` except for each group in the data frame:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 4 × 2\n#>   operator               n\n#>   <chr>              <int>\n#> 1 AMERICAN AIRLINES  14887\n#> 2 DELTA AIR LINES     9005\n#> 3 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 17970\n#> 4 UNITED AIRLINES    15116\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 2. Add geoms\n\nFor a bar chart, we use `geom_col()`, mapping `operator` to the `x` axis and `n` to the `y` axis:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = operator, y = n),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_before-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Bar chart comparing the number of flights (n) for four major airlines.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES has the highest number of flights at around 17,500, followed closely by AMERICAN AIRLINES and UNITED AIRLINES, both with about 15,000 flights. DELTA AIR LINES has the lowest number, with approximately 9,000 flights. The bars are dark gray, set against a light gray background with white gridlines. The overlapping x-axis labels make it difficult to read the airline names clearly.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 3. Can you read the labels?\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes when making a bar chart is failing to check if you can read the labels. Overlapping labels is a common problem, just like in the chart above.\n\nOften times, if the category labels overlap or are difficult to read, people will rotate the labels vertically or at an angle, which makes you tilt your head to read them. \n\nA better solutions is to just flip the coordinates with `coord_flip()`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\n ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = operator, y = n),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n\n# Flip coordinates\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_coord_flip-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Horizontal bar chart comparing the number of flights (n) for four major airlines. The y-axis lists the operators: UNITED AIRLINES, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, DELTA AIR LINES, and AMERICAN AIRLINES. The x-axis represents the number of flights, ranging from 0 to approximately 17,500. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES has the highest number of flights at around 17,500, followed closely by AMERICAN AIRLINES and UNITED AIRLINES, both with about 15,000 flights. DELTA AIR LINES has the lowest number, with approximately 9,000 flights. The bars are dark gray, set against a light gray background with white gridlines. This horizontal layout eliminates the issue of overlapping labels, making the airline names clearly readable.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOr better yet, just reverse the `x` and `y` mapping:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = operator),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_coord_flip2-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Horizontal bar chart comparing the number of flights (n) for four major airlines.

Do you need to rearrange the categories?\n\nBy default, `ggplot` will arrange the bars in alphabetical order, which is almost never what you want. \n\nIf you want to sort the bars in descending order, you can use the `reorder()` function to reorder them based on another variable. Here we'll sort the bars based on the `n` variable:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = reorder(operator, n)),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_fct_reorder-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Horizontal bar chart showing the number of flights (n) for four major airlines. The y-axis, labeled \\'reorder(operator, n)\\', lists the airlines in descending order of flight numbers: SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, UNITED AIRLINES, AMERICAN AIRLINES, and DELTA AIR LINES. The x-axis represents the number of flights, ranging from 0 to approximately 17,500. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES leads with about 17,500 flights, followed by UNITED AIRLINES and AMERICAN AIRLINES both with around 15,000 flights, and DELTA AIR LINES with approximately 9,000 flights. Bars are dark gray against a light gray background with white gridlines. This layout allows for easy comparison of flight numbers across operators, with airlines sorted from most to least flights.' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 5. Adjust scales\n\nDo you need to adjust the scales on any of the axes?\n\nOne slightly annoying feature of `ggplot` is that the bars are not flush against the axes by default. You can adjust this with the `expand` argument in `scale_x_continuous()`. The `mult = c(0, 0.05))` part is saying to make the bars flush on the left side of the bars and add 5% more space on the right side.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = reorder(operator, n)),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n\n# Adjust x axis scale\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_scales1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can also change the break points and limits of the bars with `breaks` and `limits`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = reorder(operator, n)),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n\n# Adjust x axis scale\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05)),\n    breaks = c(0, 10000, 20000),\n    limits = c(0, 20000)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_scales2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 6. Adjust theme\n\nWhile the three themes shown before are nice built-in themes, I often use one of four themes from the [`cowplot` package](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html):\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"images/cowplot_themes.png\" width=700>\n</center>\n\nFor horizontal bars, add only a vertical grid (the horizontal grid is distracting and not needed). Likewise, for vertical bars, add only a horizontal grid.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = reorder(operator, n)),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n\n# Adjust x axis scale\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n\n# Adjust theme\n  theme_minimal_vgrid()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_theme-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 7. Annotate\n\nAt a minimum, you should add a title and axis labels to your charts. In the example below, we've also modified the `operator` variable to be title case to make the labels easier to read. You can set an axis label to `NULL` if you don't want to show it, which we'll often do if it's otehrwise redundant or obvious what it is (in this case, it's obvious that the y-axis is showing airlines).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Format the data frame\nwildlife_impacts %>%\n  count(operator) %>%\n  # Make the operator names title case\n  mutate(operator = str_to_title(operator)) %>%\n\n# Add geoms\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(x = n, y = reorder(operator, n)),\n    width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n\n# Adjust x axis scale\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n\n# Adjust theme\n  theme_minimal_vgrid() +\n\n# Annotate\n  labs(\n    x = 'Count',\n    y = NULL, \n    title = \"Number of wildlife impacts by operator\", \n    subtitle = \"Top four operating airlines\",\n    caption = \"Data from the FAA Wildlife Strike Database\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figs/birds_annotate-1.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd we're done! 🎉",
